# 🪨 📄 ✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game – DOM Practice Project

Welcome to my **Rock Paper Scissors** game!  
This project was built as a **hands-on practice** to learn and explore the **Document Object Model (DOM)** in JavaScript.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is **not just a game** – it’s a milestone in my learning journey.  
I built this as my **first practical DOM project** to deeply understand how to:

- Access HTML elements via `document.querySelector`
- Handle user input with event listeners (`onclick`)
- Dynamically update the page content using JavaScript
- Use `localStorage` to persist game data
- Apply conditional logic for game rules
- Use CSS for styling and hover effects

---

## 🎮 Features

- Three choices: Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Random computer selection
- Shows result: win, lose, or draw
- Displays each move using images
- Tracks and displays total wins, losses, and draws
- Persistent score using `localStorage`
- Restart button to reset the game
- Responsive and aesthetic UI using **Flexbox** and **Gradient backgrounds**

## 📷 UI Preview

> ✨ I focused a lot on the UI — simple, clean, and stylish with rounded image buttons and gradients.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me:

- Move from theory to practical understanding of the DOM
- Build confidence working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together
- Troubleshoot and debug logic bugs (like comparing user vs computer choices)
- Work with image elements dynamically
- Handle `onclick` functions and dynamic innerHTML updates
- Improve my sense of layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy in UI design

## ❤️ Final Note

This is a **beginner-level project**, but it's close to my heart.  
I learned a lot while making it — and this is just the beginning!

> "Every great developer was once a beginner who didn't give up."  
> – And I didn’t, thanks to my curious mind and my Captain 🧠👨‍💻
